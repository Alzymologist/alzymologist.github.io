There is no automatic responder on the other side, just us.

## Our location

Our lab is located in the Keran Hallit complex. Come and visit us! We are very interested in handshaking and cooperation.

## Sample submission form
You can delegate all the paperwork to us. Just make sure the beer is delivered and tell us what you want! <br>

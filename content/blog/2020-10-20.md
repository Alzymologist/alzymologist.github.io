This is the first post, mostly to test if the website is working properly.

We have just founded the company, we still have almost no equipment and proper lab, but you've got to start somewhere!

If you somehow came across this place now, please - [let us know what you think](mailto:contact@zymologia.fi)!

If you are a microbrewer, please let us know what services are you interested in, we cannot afford to have every test in the world (yet), so more demanded tests will have to go first - [let's talk about it](mailto:contact@zymologia.fi)! Or at least let us know if you are interested, we'll add you to mailing list.

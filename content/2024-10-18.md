Finally, we have our webstore up and running at [https://store.zymologia.fi](https://store.zymologia.fi/)

Almost everything is made in Finland by us, thus don't shy from ordering out of stock items if they are on offer - some of them we do not stock but manufacture to order. Typically this would take about 2 weeks, or whatever is stated on the product page.

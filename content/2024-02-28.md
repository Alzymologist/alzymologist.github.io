Earlier this month, the Web3 Foundation presented their [Decentralized Voices](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/decentralized-voices) initiative. While being overall adepts of OpenGov and constantly presenting and voting on initiatives, we saw it as an opportunity to enhance our voice and make it stronger.

Alzymologist submitted the form for consideration and was [chosen](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-round-1-candidates-announced-23d9a800b260) to be among the program delegates on Kusama!

Now we vote louder ðŸ˜ˆ
